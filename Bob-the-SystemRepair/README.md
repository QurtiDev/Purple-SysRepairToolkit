üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bob-the-SystemRepair PowerShell Script üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
====================


A simple, yet reliable PowerShell script for a deep Windows system scanning and repair. I made this for for quick reviews and fixing common issues, but also doing a deep system scan and logging everything. 

Basically Bob:
- Provides color-coded console output based on severity!
- Logs all key findings into your desktop as a log file for later review!
- Performs deep system checks and repairs (including SFC, DISM, Windows Defender, etc, you can read more below).


> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** ‚ö†Ô∏è 
> Script is *unsigned* (Signing a PowerShell script is not cheap üò≠). Run with:  
>
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
>```
> To run safely for this session only!
> Inspect the code if you want to!
> 
> Make sure to execute as **Administrator**! Scan will not start without elevated privileges, as it would otherwise do a very lacking scan.  
> üõ°Ô∏è Results from Defender full scan and MRT are **not** saved in `BobScans.log`.

## Important Warnings for you to know about!

- **Do not interrupt the scan!** Canceling repairs may cause unexpected problems.
- **Review flagged entries manually** false *positives* are very possible, but don‚Äôt ignore red flagsd by default.
- **Restart required:** Some repairs won't take effect without rebooting. *Script will prompt if one is needed though!*.
- **Skipped temp files:** Skipped files may still be malicious! Investigate further if you're concerned, you should review the log either from the file or via log output!

## Note this:
Bob is best used by users with basic PowerShell and Windows admin skills, although it's very much usable by anyone on any skill level as long as you can turn your computer on!

! Always review the log and flagged items before making system changes !
